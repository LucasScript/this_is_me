    'Profile': `I have more than 4 years' employment experience in software development. From June 2017 I entered a roll where I developed mainly in a full stack environment. Prior to this I was in a roll where I developed in a Java environment. 
    
    My time working in the financial industry has taught me a lot as I improved legacy and built new features to assist the business to grow in providing better client experience.

    I like to see myself not just as a developer but as a software craftsman that code by principles that improve the current and empowers the future. 
    
    When I'am not coding I enjoy cycling, photography and gaming.`,
